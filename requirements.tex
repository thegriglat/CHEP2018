Software validation is a continuous complex process involving the entire Geant4 community. The main goal of the application we describe here is to provide a fast and convenient web-based validation tool for Geant4 developers.

Below there is a brief list of the design ideas
%that were trying to implement in this validation application
and how they were implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The procedure for integrating new Geant4 tests should be simple and straightforward;
    \item User should be able to display and analyse one- and multidimensional histograms and scatter plots, with same or different binning;
    \item User should be able to compare tests results with experimental data;
    \item It should be possible to produce high quality plots with custom plot style, ranges, scales, etc. using only the website;
    % \item Providing to users as much information about tests results as possible;
    % \item High parallelism to run and analyse a large set of Geant4 tests in reasonable time; % To achieve this the system should provide a way to run Geant4 tests in highly diversified jobs in batch systems.
    \item Application should have intuitive, modern and fast user interface;
    %% \item Scalability: 
    \item Should use the technologies that allows a fast feature development and integration.
\end{itemize}

To implement these ideas in practice we decided to write the server and client parts of the application in JavaScript, using Node.js~\cite{NodeJS} and AngularJS~\cite{AngularJS}, respectively, and to use ROOT~\cite{ROOT} framework along with JSROOT~\cite{JSROOT} library to produce high quality plots. Python and C++ were used for writing service utilities.

In order to keep data consistent over all application services a \textit{plot} data type was introduced. A \textit{plot} object is a central element of the data model of \textsf{Geant-val} application, used for exchanging data between different parts of the web application: displaying data on the web page, calculating result of statistical tests etc. Files containing \textit{plot} objects in JSON~\cite{json} format are used for uploading data to the database, generating plots with standalone C++ plotter utility. 
Each \textit{plot} consists of histogram or scatter plot data and necessary metadata describing configuration used to run Monte-Carlo simulation (Geant4 version, physics list), test parameters (beams, targets, energies, etc.) and its results (e.g., the name of the quantity measured).

A Python tool named {\tt mc-config-generator} was developed to produce JSON files containing \textit{plot} objects from test output. It also provides a uniform way to prepare and run tests on the batch system (LSF, Torque PBS, HTCondor), and to get information about execution times and any Geant4 exceptions generated during test execution.

For faster deployment, the application is distributed as a Docker image which is hosted on virtual machine provided by CERN VM service. The website is optimised for asynchronous access and plotting and can be easily scaled ''horizontally'' by launching new instances.%, as the application has no software and hardware requirements except presence of running Docker server.
