A validation of software is a complex process involving entire Geant4 community starting from developers of core functionality end to users. Below we briefly list the requirements of validation system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple integration of current set of Geant4 tests;
    \item Support for various test's output formats -- ROOT and plain text;
    \item \textbf{High parallelism} is needed to be possible run a large set of Geant4 tests in reasonable time. To achieve this the system should provide a way to run Geant4 tests in highly diversificated jobs in batch systems.
    
    \item Frienly user interface;
    \item User-driven developing;
\end{itemize}
