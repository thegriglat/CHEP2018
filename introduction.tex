\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-introduction}
Geant4~\cite{Geant4} is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. Its areas of application include high energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space science. 

Geant4 is following a yearly release cycle, with internal test releases published almost every month.
Most of test's developers perform internal validation of the code based on different approaches using wide stack of technologies such as PHP, C++, Python and others.
It leads to strong bindings between Geant4 tests source code and internal validation tools.
Therefore there is no simply way to compare Geant4 releases between themselves in total.

It was decided in CERN SFT group to develop a tool for quick release validation by performing statistical and visual comparison both to previous release(s), and to experimental data. 
The presented tool is JavaScript single page application working with especially developed tool for Geant4 tests configuration.
