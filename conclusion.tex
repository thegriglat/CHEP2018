\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-status}

The presented software provides an uniform and clear way of performing all stages of physics validation: from creating configuration files and running simulation code to producing and analysing final plots.

The web interface allows performing quick visual evaluation of MC-experiment agreement for various combinations of Geant4 versions and physics lists. %Convenient and practical web interface allows users easily determine changes or models which leads to agreement improvement or degradation with other results or experimental data. 
\texttt{mc-config-generator}'s submission system allows one to easily submit jobs to any supported batch system, and to analyse the produced results.%, as well as execution time and Geant4 exceptions.

The \textsf{Geant-val} web application
% and the {\tt mc-config-generator} framework are 
is actively used by Geant4 developers in CERN and by Geant4 Medical Simulation Benchmark Group (G4BSMG).


% At the moment, 12 Geant4 tests are fully integrated in Geant Validation system and have layouts on the website (see Table~\ref{table:tests}):

% Currently, the application's database contains 86213 test histograms and charts as well as 1414 experimental datasets.
