\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-status}

The presented software provides an uniform and clear way of performing all stages of physics validation: from creating configuration files and running simulation code to producing final plots.

The \textsf{Geant-val} web application and the {\tt mc-config-generator} framework are actively used by Geant4 developers in CERN and by Geant4 Medical Simulation Benchmark Group (G4BSMG).


% At the moment, 12 Geant4 tests are fully integrated in Geant Validation system and have layouts on the website (see Table~\ref{table:tests}):
