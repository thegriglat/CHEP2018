\section{Validation work flow}
\label{sec-workflow}

To perform Geant4 validation using given test one needs to run test, convert test's output to Geant validation JSON format (see Appendix~\ref{adx:JSON-format}) and upload produced files to the website.

To build a test it is possible to use CERN Gitlab repository\footnote{https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation/geant-validation-tests}, which provides a simple way to compile the test for any Geant4 version (if the test supports requested version of Geant4).
Then one needs to integrate the test in {\tt geant-config-generator} system to be able produce and parse tests results.

Uploading of JSON files is performed by {\tt geant\_upload.py}\footnote{https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation/GVP/raw/master/scripts/geant\_upload.py} console utility.
After uploading the results are available on the website to view and analyze.
