\section{User interface}
\label{sec-analyse}

The \textsf{Geant-val} website provides two ways of viewing and comparing results:

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Layout for the Geant4 "simplified calorimeter" test with results for Geant4 reference releases 10.4.ref07, 10.4.ref08 and physics lists FTFP\_BERT and QGSP\_BERT.}
    \label{fig:layouts}
\end{figure}

\textit{Statistical comparisons} page allows one to perform comparison of simulation with compatible experimental results using statistical tests and visually. % It displays results of statistical comparison for pairs of plots with the same parameters' values.

In visual mode  (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sc_visual_ratio}) one can select various parameters in left side drop down menu and request plots corresponding selected values. In this mode page it is possible to mark one Geant4 release as "reference" to get ratio plots between several results.

In statistical mode (see Fig.~\ref{fig:statcomparison}) the page shows results of $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2/n.d.f.$, $\chi^2$ probability) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS Max(D), KS probability) tests between two Geant4 releases for all matching pairs of test results.
All computations are performed asynchronously on the client side using JavaScript WebWorkers. For this purpose, JavaScript code to perform $\chi^2$ and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests have been written, and their results cross-checked against the same statistical techniques implemented in the ROOT framework ({\tt ROOT::TH1::Chi2Test()} and {\tt ROOT:TMath::KolmogorovTest()} correspondingly).

\end{figure}



\textit{User layouts} page (see Fig.~\ref{fig:layouts}). Some Geant4 tests produce hundreds of different plots, but for fast "visual" validation it is often enough to compare only a small well-defined subset of them. The \textit{layout} is an XML file describing what plots should be displayed and how should they be laid out on a page. User can use one of the existing layouts or define their own one.
