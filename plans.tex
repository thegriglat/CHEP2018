\section{Plans}
\label{sec-status}

There are major tasks to be done in the future:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Migrate the client side of the application to the Angular2+ framework;
	\item Improve the statistical comparison page;
	\item Improve the {\tt mc-config-generator} framework;
	\item Add more tests for Geant4 as well as for other projects: this is, of course, the most important and (human-)time consuming task!
\end{itemize}
